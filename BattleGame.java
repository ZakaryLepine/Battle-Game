 * Assignment 4
 * Written by: Zakary Lepine 40192181
 * For COMP248 Section W â€“ Winter 2021
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 *PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 *Displays welcome message
 *Asks user for number of creatures for battle game. Keeps asking user until valid number of creatures is inputed (> 2 and < 9).
 *Creates Creature array of the size previously inputed by user. 
 *Asks user for name of creatures.
 *Generates random number to choose starting creature.
 *Loops through creature playing turns starting with index of creature array that matches the random number.
 *Display 6 playing choice for current creature if creature is alive.
 *Choice 1: Displays number of creatures alive.
 *Choice 2: Displays current creature's non-static attributes.
 *Choice 3: Displays all creature's non-static attributes.
 *Choice 4: Changes current creatures name by user's input.
 *Choice 5: Calls earnFood() method which adds between 0 to 15 food units to current creature.
 *Choice 6: Calls attacking() method that attacks creature with index that user inputs (user input is decreased by 1 to match the index of the creature chosen since array indexes begin at 0). 
 *Choice 6: Random number between 0-2 is generated
 *Choice 6: If attacking creature has < 2 fire power units and attacked creature has < 2 fire power units, no one is attacked.
 *Choice 6: else if attacking creature has < 2 fire power units and attacked creatures has >= 2 fire power units, attacking creature is attacked instead.
 *Choice 6: else if random number = 0, attacking creature is attacked instead.
 *Choice 6: else attacking creature attacks (random number = 1 or 2).
 *Choice 6: isAlive() method is called on attacked creature and displays "-----> <creature name> is dead!" if method is returned false.
 *If oneCreatureAliveLeft() method returns true, breaks out of creature playing turn loop.
 *Else if i = last index of the creature array, i = -1. Then, i is incremented to 0 which "resets" the creature playing turn loop to the first index of the creature array.
 *Displays game over message and non-static attributes of all creatures.
 *Displays closing message
